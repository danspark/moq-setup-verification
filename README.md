# Moq.Extensions.SetupWithVerification

This library provides two extension methods (and two classes) for creating setups with a matching verification, this makes you write less code and avoid errors such as mismatching expressions between setup and verification.

## Usage

```csharp
var mock = new Mock<MyClass>();
```
